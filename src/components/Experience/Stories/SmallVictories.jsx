      As I settled into my role, I began paving my way further into test
      automation while also helping clients understand the technical aspects of
      our projects. I took on the challenge of bridging the gap between IT and
      the client side, facilitating User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure that
      both teams were aligned. To enhance my skills in test automation, I
      completed a comprehensive 71-hour JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
      This course deepened my understanding of test automation and development
      as a whole, empowering me to contribute more effectively to my team. Each
      small victory reinforced my confidence and commitment to continuous
      learning in this dynamic field.
