      It all started with a simple idea. While scrolling through social media, I
      saw an ad for a Software Testing bootcamp that piqued my interest. I
      thought, &quot;Why not?&quot; and enrolled in the four-month program. The
      experience was both challenging and rewarding, culminating in my ISTQB
      certification. Eager to expand my skills, I also began learning test
      automation on my own. This journey transformed my curiosity into a
      fulfilling career path and ignited a passion for continuous learning in
      the ever-evolving tech landscape.
