      As I grew more proficient in test automation, I discovered a newfound
      passion for development. Motivated to expand my skills, I decided to learn
      React on my own, just as I had with test automation. I was fortunate to
      get the chance to contribute to our company website, which was built with
      Next.js and WordPress. I began writing components, fixing bugs, and
      creating component tests, all while managing my testing tasks. This
      experience required me to prioritize my time effectively to balance
      multiple responsibilities. Additionally, I enrolled in a one-month React
      bootcamp in Estonia, which further solidified my understanding and skills
      in development. Each step I took reinforced my commitment to continuous
      improvement and deepened my love for coding.
